When a VSTO-based application starts up, and sometime after 
the initialization event has occurred, the startup event for 
the sheets object is fired. By placing code in the startup 
event handler, the VSTO run-time guarantees that the sheet 
object will be ready to service client requests. In the 
code example in Listing 2-2, the method FileProcessor is 
used to open a file on disk in read mode. 
This piece of code is not expected to win any award for 
elegance; however it does illustrate a few important concepts 
that warrant further explanation. There is no exception 
handling in the code. The code simply assumes that the file 
exists and is readable. Such assumptions may easily be violated 
in real-world software. The example is without this safety 
net for illustrative purposes only. 
Some of the code snippets in this book are intentionally 
kept simple to illustrate the concepts clearly. Once you 
have a basic understanding of the concepts, you should be 
able to implement any requirement in code.
