AspNet Identity 2.0 with Group-Based Permissions Management
extend the ASP.NET MVC 5 Identity system and implement a Group-based permission scheme. 
Users belong to Groups, and Groups have sets of authorization permissions to exxecute code within the application


The Group-Based Permissions project attempts to find a middle ground between the complexities of a full-blown, Claims-based authorization scheme,
 and the simplicity (and limitations) of the authorization offered by Identity out of the box. 
 
	Users are assigned to one or more Groups. 
	Groups are granted set of permissions corresponding to the various authorizations required by group members to perform their function.
